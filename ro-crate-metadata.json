Cell-cycle progression hits were KOs with the proportion of cells in greater than two 2-cell cycle stages outside the 95% bootstrap confidence interval of the corresponding wild-type stages. Genotypic and visual quality controls were done for corroboration. Hits were large-scale validated with ten times independent rescreening (see Protocol) and if picked in R35% of cases kept as high-confidence hits for analysis. Support vector machine clas- sifiers assigned eight phenotypic classes to cell shape hits. ERA rates (Kafri et al., 2013) were calculated for cell-cycle progression hits.

Here, we used multiprocess phenotypic profiling, combining high-resolution 3D confocal microscopy and multiparametric image analysis, to simultaneously survey the fission yeast genome with respect to three key cellular processes: cell shape, microtubule organization, and cell-cycle progression. We identify, validate, and functionally annotate 262 genes controlling specific aspects of those processes. Of these, 62% had not been linked to these processes before and 35% are implicated in multiple processes. Importantly, we identify a conserved role for DNA-damage responses in controlling microtubule stability. In addition, we investigate how the processes are functionally linked. We show unexpectedly that disruption of cell-cycle progression does not necessarily affect cell size control and that distinct aspects of cell shape regulate microtubules and vice versa, identifying important systems-level links across these processes.",

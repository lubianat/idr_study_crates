      "description": "A data-driven analysis of cell morphology and intracellular organization in the developing zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium, a model tissue for the study of self-organized morphogenesis. 3D image stacks were acquired using AiryScan FAST-mode confocal fluorescence microscopy. Automated single-cell segmentation and point cloud-based morphometry were developed to extract numerical features representing cell morphology and intracellular protein distributions. Machine learning was used with the extracted numerical features to perform data integration across experiments and context-guided data visualization. The resulting data was analyzed to discover biologically meaningful patterns at the cell and tissue scale.",

Where applicable, lysosomes were stained by treating embryos with 1?M LysoTracker Deep Red in E3 medium with 1% DMSO for 90 minutes prior to mounting. For imaging, embryos were dechorionated manually, anaesthetized with 0.01% Tricaine and mounted in 1% peqGOLD Low Melt Agarose in E3 containing 0.01% Tricaine in a MatTek Glass Bottom Microwell Dish (35mm Petri dish, 10mm microwell, 0.16-0.19mm coverglass). Imaging was performed on the Zeiss LSM880 AiryScan confocal microscope in FAST mode with a 40X 1.2NA water objective with Immersol W immersion fluid. Deconvolution was performed using the ZEN Black Software's 3D AiryScan deconvolution with 'auto' settings. Where appropriate, linear unmixing of channel bleed-through was performed as described in the Study Publication. Automated single-cell segmentation was performed using a custom python pipeline based on thresholding and watershed expansion, described in detail in the Study Publication."

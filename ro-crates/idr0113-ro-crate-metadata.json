      "description": "Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) retain the capacity to remyelinate axons in the corpus callosum (CC) upon demyelination. However, the dynamics of OPC activation, mode of cell division, migration, and differentiation on a single cell level remain poorly understood due to the lack of longitudinal observations of individual cells within the injured brain. After inducing focal demyelination with lysophosphatidylcholin (LPC) in the CC of adult mice, we used 2-photon microscopy to follow for up to 2 months OPCs and their differentiating progeny, genetically labeled through conditional recombination driven by the regulatory elements of the gene Achaete-scute homolog 1 (Ascl1). OPCs underwent several rounds of symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions, producing a subset of daughter cells that differentiates into myelinating oligodendrocytes. While OPCs continue to proliferate, differentiation into myelinating oligodendrocytes declines with time and death of OPC-derived daughter cells increases. Thus, chronic in vivo imaging delineates the cellular principles leading to remyelination in the adult brain, providing a framework for the development of novel strategies to enhance endogenous brain repair in acute and chronic demyelinating disease.",

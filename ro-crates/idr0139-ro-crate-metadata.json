      "description": "Fascin is an important regulator of F-actin bundling leading to enhanced filopodia assembly. Fascin is also overexpressed in most solid tumours where it supports invasion through control of F-actin structures at the periphery and nuclear envelope. Recently fascin has been identified in the nucleus of a broad range of cell types but the contributions of nuclear fascin to cancer cell behaviour remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that fascin bundles F-actin within the nucleus to support chromatin organisation and efficient DNA damage response. Fascin associates directly with phosphorylated Histone H3 leading to regulated levels of nuclear fascin to support these phenotypes. Forcing nuclear fascin accumulation through the expression of nuclear-targeted fascin-specific nanobodies or inhibition of Histone H3 kinases results in enhanced and sustained nuclear F-actin bundling leading to reduced invasion, viability and nuclear fascin-specific/driven apoptosis. These findings represent an additional important route through which fascin can support tumorigenesis and provide insight into potential pathways for targeted fascin-dependent cancer cell killing.",

      "description": "To further refine the identified compounds and targets that enhanced nuclear fascin and F-actin in terms of functional importance, we performed an additional screen to detect apoptosis using a representative panel of 52 compounds that inhibited various pathways but all targeted fascin to the nucleus. Fascin KD HeLa cells expressing mScarlet or mScarlet-fascin were used for this analysis to identify fascin-dependent responses to compounds. Cells were treated with all compounds at a range of concentrations and imaged using automated high-content microscopy in the presence of a fluorescence-based caspase reporter (that fluoresced at 488nm only upon onset of apoptosis) over 72 h. Resulting data were quantified to produce apoptosis AC50 values for all compounds in both control and fascin KD cells. From these data, we identified 15 compounds that promoted apoptosis at lower concentrations in mScarlet-fascin expressing cells than in fascin KD cells."

Cells were cultured at 37¡C, 5% CO2 in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were selected and maintained using puromycin, and sub-cultured using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA in PBS. In this assay, cells were plated in CellCarrier Ultra 384 well plates (PerkinElmer) at a concentration of 1,000 cells/well plus 2 mM CellEvent Caspase 3/7 Green detection reagent (ThermoFisher).",

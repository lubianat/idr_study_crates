      "description": "During early Drosophila embryogenesis, a network of gene regulatory interactions orchestrates terminal patterning, playing a critical role in the subsequent formation of the gut. We utilized CRISPR gene editing at endogenous loci to create live reporters of transcription and light-sheet microscopy to monitor the individual components of posterior patterning network across 90 minutes prior to gastrulation. We developed a computational pipeline for fusing imaging datasets of the individual components into a common multivariable trajectory. This heterogeneous data fusion approach revealed low intrinsic dimensionality of posterior patterning and cell fate specification in wild type embryos.",

Exposure time for the green channel was 55 ms and exposure for the red channel was 70 ms.  The line illumination tool was used to improve background levels and was set to 40 pixels. Image segmentation was performed for each 2D slice using a program called ilastik, which utilizes semantic segmentation. 3D object creation from 2D binary images and feature extraction was performed in a program called Arivis."

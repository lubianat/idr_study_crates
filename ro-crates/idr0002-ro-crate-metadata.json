      "description": "The advent of genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) based screens puts us in the position to identify genes for all functions human cells carry out. However, for many functions, assay complexity and cost make genome-scale knockdown experiments impossible. Methods to predict genes required for cell functions are therefore needed to focus RNAi screens from the whole genome on the most likely candidates. Although different bioinformatics tools for gene function prediction exist, they lack experimental validation and are therefore rarely used by experimentalists. To address this, we developed an effective computational gene selection strategy that represents public data about genes as graphs and then analyzes these graphs using kernels on graph nodes to predict functional relationships. To demonstrate its performance, we predicted human genes required for a poorly understood cellular function 'mitotic chromosome condensation' and experimentally validated the top 100 candidates with a focused RNAi screen by automated microscopy. Quantitative analysis of the images demonstrated that the candidates were indeed strongly enriched in condensation genes, including the discovery of several new factors. By combining bioinformatics prediction with experimental validation, our study shows that kernels on graph nodes are powerful tools to integrate public biological data and predict genes involved in cellular functions of interest.",

      "description": "Images were acquired with an automated epifluorescence microscope (IX-81; Olympus-Europe, Hamburg, Germany) with a 20_ objective and a time interval of 8.5 min for 44 h. Four independent replicates were acquired for each siRNA treatment. Images were processed using the CellCognition software (Held et al., 2010). Only the H2B-mCherry channel was used. After segmentation, a training set was assembled by manually assigning _1800 nuclei from negative control wells to one of the following 10 classes based on the morphological aspect of the nuclei: interphase, early prophase, late prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, early anaphase, late anaphase, apoptosis, artifact, and out of focus. Early prophase was defined as the first visually detectable changes in the texture of chromatin after interphase, and late prophase was defined as the first appearance of clearly condensed chromatin before prometaphase. This late-prophase definition corresponds to events preceding complete disassembly of the nuclear envelope as judged by the LMNA-eGFP marker. All nuclei were then automatically assigned by a multiclass support vector machine to one of these classes. Mitoses were detected as any transition from interphase to one or more of prophase, prometaphase, or metaphase followed by at least one of either metaphase or anaphase. Mitotic nuclei were then tracked for 22 frames (eight before the detected transition and 14 after). Mitoses with too-dark nuclei or for which the first eight frames before the transition were not classified as interphase (e.g., out-of-focus nuclei) were discarded. Wells with fewer than five valid mitoses were discarded.",

      "description": "Lack of condensin function, which results in absence of condensation in prophase, translated in our screen as a shorter prophase because the prophase class definition is based on the visual appearance of condensation before nuclear envelope breakdown. In negative control cells (i.e., treated with nontargeting siRNAs), the mode of duration of prophase was two frames (17 min). To get an overview of the screen, we derived a short prophase score for each gene as the median of the difference in the fraction of shorter prophase between all replicates involving the gene and corresponding negative controls (i.e., nontargeting siRNA). Similarly, we defined a long-prophase score by looking at the fraction of mitoses with prophase lasting >17 min. Then for each well, we tested whether the fraction of mitoses with prophase less (respectively more) than two frames was significantly different from the corresponding plate's pooled negative controls (Fisher's exact test with p < 0.1). A siRNA was then considered to affect mitotic chromosome condensation if it produced the same significant change in prophase duration in at least two replicates. A combined p value over replicates was calculated using the QFAST algorithm (Bailey and Gribskov, 1998), and siRNAs with combined p > 0.05 were not considered as hits.",

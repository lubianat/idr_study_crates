      "name": "Cohesin-mediated DNA loop extrusion resolves sister chromatids in G2 phase",
      "description": "Genetic information is stored in linear DNA molecules, which fold extensively inside cells. DNA replication along the folded template path yields two sister chromatids that initially occupy the same nuclear region in a highly intertwined arrangement. Dividing cells must disentangle and condense the sister chromatids into separate bodies such that a microtubule-based spindle can move them to opposite poles. While the spindle-mediated transport of sister chromatids has been studied in detail, the chromosome-intrinsic mechanics pre-segregating sister chromatids have remained elusive. Here, we show that human sister chromatids resolve extensively already during interphase, in a process dependent on the loop-extruding activity of cohesin, but not that of condensins. Increasing cohesin’s looping capability increases sister DNA resolution in interphase nuclei to an extent normally seen only during mitosis, despite the presence of abundant arm cohesion. That cohesin can resolve sister chromatids so extensively in the absence of mitosis-specific activities indicates that DNA loop extrusion is a generic mechanism for segregating replicated genomes, shared across different Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes in all kingdoms of life.",

Cells were then washed twice with pre-warmed PBS and released into fresh medium. 10 – 12 h after release, cells were blocked again using 3 μg mL-1 aphidicolin (Sigma Aldrich, A0781) for 16 – 18 h. To generate one-sister chromatid labelled cells, 10 μM F-ara-EdU (Sigma Aldrich, T511293) was added to cells 15 h after the second release into S phase (after the first release for the NIPBL-AID cell line) to generate a pool of the compound within the cell, while the cells were in aphidicolin. The following day, cells were washed twice with pre-warmed PBS and released into fresh medium containing 10 μM F-ara-EdU. A final block with aphidicolin was then performed as described above. The following day, cells were washed twice with pre-warmed PBS and released into fresh nucleotide-free medium, such that the cells became labelled on only one sister chromatid.After labelling of sister chromatids, cells were synchronised to G2 using the CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 (Sigma Aldrich, SML0569). For G2 samples 10 μM RO-3306 was added 5 – 6 h after the release from the final aphidicolin block. WAPL was depleted through the addition of 1 μM dTAG-7 14 h after the final S phase release. Wild type G2 cells were fixed after 15 h S phase release. WAPL depleted G2 cells were fixed 24 h after the final S-phase release. To generate prophase samples, 7 μM RO-3306 was added as described above, after 15 h S-phase release, cells were washed 3 times with wild type medium and released into 5 μM STLC-containig medium.",

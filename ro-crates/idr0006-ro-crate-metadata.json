      "description": "The nucleus is a unique organelle that contains essential genetic materials in chromosome territories. The interchromatin space is composed of nuclear subcompartments, which are defined by several distinctive nuclear bodies believed to be factories of DNA or RNA processing and sites of transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional regulation. In this paper, we performed a genome-wide microscopy-based screening for proteins that form nuclear foci and characterized their localizations using markers of known nuclear bodies. In total, we identified 325 proteins localized to distinct nuclear bodies, including nucleoli (148), promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (38), nuclear speckles (27), paraspeckles (24), Cajal bodies (17), Sam68 nuclear bodies (5), Polycomb bodies (2), and uncharacterized nuclear bodies (64). Functional validation revealed several proteins potentially involved in the assembly of Cajal bodies and paraspeckles. Together, these data establish the first atlas of human proteins in different nuclear bodies and provide key information for research on nuclear bodies.",

The plasmid DNAs were purified using a high quality 96_plasmid DNA purification kit (PureLink; Invitrogen). A day before transfection, 6 x 103 HeLa cells were seeded on 96_ well optical bottom plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plasmid transfection was performed with the use of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, cells were subjected to ionizing radiation (IR; 10 Gy) and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde 6 h later. Next, the cells were permeabilized with a 0.5% Triton X_100 solution and blocked with 3% BSA. Cells were then subjected to incubation with anti_Flag antibodies (1:5,000 dilution) for 2 h, after which they were washed extensively with PBS and incubated with rhodamine_conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) at room temperature for 1 h. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI."

The secondary screen of proteins forming nuclear foci was conducted in untreated or IR_treated cells. Because 325 proteins con_ stitutively form nuclear foci in untreated or IR_treated cells, the validation of 325 proteins with nuclear foci localization was conducted manually using various markers of nuclear bodies or distinct nucleolus morphology in un_ treated cells. Considering that subcellular localizations of the various nuclear body markers we used are largely distinct from each other, we have not assessed colocalization of each gene with all six marker proteins se_ quentially. Instead, we scored a protein as positive for a particular nuclear body component in the case of it showing >70% overlapping with any marker protein. During the course of the analysis, we were aware that some proteins colocalize with both PML and paraspeckles, and therefore, we examined whether the identified PML proteins also localize to para_ speckles or vice versa. Eventually, eight proteins were found to localize in both nuclear subcompartments."

      "description": "The genome folds into a hierarchy of three-dimensional structures within the nucleus. At the sub-megabase scale, chromosomes form topologically associating domains (TADs). However, how TADs fold in single cells is elusive. Here, we reveal TAD features inaccessible to cell population analysis by using super-resolution microscopy. TAD structures and physical insulation associated with their borders are variable between individual cells,  yet chromatin intermingling is enriched within TADs compared to adjacent TADs in most cells. The spatial segregation of TADs is further exacerbated during cell differentiation.  Favored interactions within TADs are regulated by cohesin and CTCF through distinct mechanisms:  cohesin generates chromatin contacts and intermingling while CTCF prevents inter-TAD contacts.  Furthermore, TADs are subdivided into discrete nanodomains, which persist in cells depleted of CTCF or cohesin,  whereas disruption of nucleosome contacts alters their structural organization. Altogether, these results provide a physical basis for the fold\u0002ing of individual chromosomes at the nanoscale.",

(PMID: 32820407; DOI: 10.1007/978-1-0716-0664-3_13). Here, pairs of Oligopaint probes labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 and ATTO 565 fluorophores were used for OFs and 3D distance measurements, only Oligopaint probes labeled with ATTO 565 were used to count the number of  CNDs inside TADs. The number of oligos per Oligopaint probe depends on its genomic size and the density of oligos found in that region. The coordinates, the size and the number of oligos for each Oligopaint probe can be found in the Extended Data Fig.9 of the article. Each oligo carryies 3 fluorophores allowing a robust fluorescent signal of each Oligopaint probe. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Coverslips containing cells were mounted on slides with VECTASHIELD and sealed with nail polish. 3D-SIM imaging was performed with a DeltaVision OMX V4 microscope equipped with a x100/1.4 numerical aperture (NA) Plan Super Apochromat oil immersion objective (Olympus) and electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (Evolve 512B; Photometrics) camera for a pixel size of 80 nm. Diode lasers at 405, 488, 561 and 647 nm were used with the standard corresponding emission filters. Z-stacks were acquired by scanning the sample in the axial direction (z-step of 125 nm) using 5 phases and 3 angles per image plane. Raw images were reconstructed using SoftWorx v.6.5 (GE Healthcare Systems) using channel-specific optical transfer functions (pixel size of reconstructed images = 40 nm). The quality of reconstructed images was assessed using the SIMcheck plugin (doi: 10.1038/srep15915) of ImageJ v.1.52i.",

      "description": "In the NPC dataset, mouse ESCs described in Experiment Mouse_ESC_TADs were differentiated into NPCs as described by Gaspard et al. (doi: 10.1038/nprot.2009.157) with the following changes. Cells were plated (2.5 x 10e5 cells per 10-cm dish) on 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes in the ESC medium described in Experiment Mouse_ESC_TADs. After 1 day, cells were cultured in DDM medium (DMEM/F-12, GlutaMAX supplement; catalog no. 31331028; Gibco), supplemented with 0.05% bovine albumin fraction (catalog no. 15260037; Gibco), 1x MEM non-essential amino acids, 50 U penicillin-streptomycin, 1x N-2 supplement (catalog no. 17502048; Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. From day 2 to day 10, medium was changed every 2 days and cyclopamine V. californicum (catalog no. 239803; Merck Millipore) was added to the medium (final concentration of 0.4ug/ml). After 12 days of differentiation, cells were dissociated with StemPro Accutase (catalog no. A1110501; Gibco), plated on 6-well plates (containing an autoclaved glass coverslip (170 ± 5 μm (ZEISS)) coated with poly-L-lysine (catalog no. P2636; Sigma-Aldrich)/laminin (catalog no. 11243217001; Sigma-Aldrich) and cultured in a 1:1 mixture of DDM and neurobasal medium (catalog no. 21103049; Gibco) supplemented with 1X B-27 supplement minus vitamin A (catalog no. 12587010; Gibco) and 1x GlutaMAX supplement and 50 U penicillin-streptomycin for an additional 2 days (day 12 + 2) to obtain NPCs. Coverslips containing NPCs were then washed once with PBS before fixation prior to the FISH procedure. For the ncxNPC dataset, Mouse brains from E14.5 C57BL/6J embryos were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4°C. They were then cryopreserved for 24 h at 4°C in a PBS-20% sucrose solution. After embedding in optimal cutting temperature compound and rapid freezing in isopentane, brains were sectioned at 10-um width on glass slides with a cryostat (Leica Biosystems). Slides containing fixed mouse brain neocortex were then submitted to the FISH procedure.",

      "description": "Cells were hybridized with the Oligopaint fluorescent probe using a DNA FISH protocol, which is briefly described in the article and a detailed protocol can be found in Szabo et al. (PMID: 32820407; DOI: 10.1007/978-1-0716-0664-3_13). Here, the Oligopaint probe was labeled with ATTO 565 fluorophore. The coordinates, the size and the number of oligos for the Drosophila TAD probe can be found in the Extended Data Fig.9 of the article. Each oligo of the probe carries 3 fluorophores. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Coverslips containing cells were mounted on slides with VECTASHIELD and sealed with nail polish. 3D-SIM imaging was performed with a DeltaVision OMX V4 microscope equipped with a x100/1.4 numerical aperture (NA) Plan Super Apochromat oil immersion objective (Olympus) and electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (Evolve 512B; Photometrics) camera for a pixel size of 80 nm. Diode lasers at 405, 488, 561 and 647 nm were used with the standard corresponding emission filters. Z-stacks were acquired by scanning the sample in the axial direction (z-step of 125 nm) using 5 phases and 3 angles per image plane.

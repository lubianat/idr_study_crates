      "description": "To identify possible candidates for progression towards clinical studies against SARS-CoV-2, we screened a well-defined collection of 5632 compounds including 3488 compounds which have undergone clinical investigations (marketed drugs, phases 1 -3, and withdrawn) across 600 indications. Compounds were screened for their inhibition of viral induced cytotoxicity using the human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 and a SARS-CoV-2 isolate. The primary screen of 5632 compounds gave 271 hits. A total of 64 compounds with IC50 <20 μM were identified, including 19 compounds with IC50 < 1 μM. Of this confirmed hit population, 90% have not yet been previously reported as active against SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro cell assays. Some 37 of the actives are launched drugs, 19 are in phases 1-3 and 10 pre-clinical. Several inhibitors were associated with modulation of host pathways including kinase signaling P53 activation, ubiquitin pathways and PDE activity modulation, with long chain acyl transferases were effective viral inhibitors.",

Well level data were analysed using ActivityBase (IDBS) and R (v.3.6.1). Test well results were normalized relative to the corresponding intra-plate control (no virus assigned as 100% inhibition of cellular toxicity, with virus assigned as 0% inhibition of cellular toxicity). Outliers were eliminated according to 3-sigma method. Plate level statistical performance was assessed using the standard Z’ calculation5. Dose response curves fitted in GraphPad Prism v.8.0.0 (GraphPad Software) using a 4-parameter logarithmic (least squares fit). Hits were further selected for dose response studies based on the progression of the compounds in clinical development. Therefore drugs in clinical use were priorised over phase 2 compounds, which were priorized over phase 1 or phase 1/phase 2 compounds.",

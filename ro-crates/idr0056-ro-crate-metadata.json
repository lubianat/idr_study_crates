      "description": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate many biological processes and have been implicated in development and disease pathogenesis. The exact function for the large majority of lncRNAs is still unknown. To address whether lncRNAs could play a role in cell division, we combined a microscopy-based high-content RNAi screen with dedicated image analysis workflows to identify lncRNAs that regulate mitotic progression, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. By targeting over 2000 lncRNAs in HeLa cells, we discovered an assortment of new lncRNAs with unexplored functions in maintenance of genome stability.",

      "description": "Growth Protocol - HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco, 41966-029) supplemented with 10% Fetal bovine serum (FBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10500064). Exponentially growing cells were reverse transfected with 20nM of siRNA. An siRNA targeting exon 1 of lncRNA GNG12-AS1 (Silencer select, Life Technologies, S59962) and SMARTpool siRNAs targeting protein-coding gene CKAP5/Ch-TOG (GE Dharmacon, L-006847-00) were also included on each plate. CKAP5/Ch-TOG was used as a positive control as its depletion leads to mitotic delay and increased mitotic index. ECT2 SMARTpool siRNAs (GE Dharmacon, L-006450-00-0005) were used as a positive control only in the third validation screen as its depletion results in multinucleated cells. 48 hr after transfection cells were fixed and stained with appropriate antibodies.",

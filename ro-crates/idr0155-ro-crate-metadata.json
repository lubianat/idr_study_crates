      "name": "A new method for reliably detecting single fluorescent puncta in structured backgrounds",
      "description": "Super-resolution and single-molecule microscopy are increasingly being applied to complex biological systems. While this can lead greater insight, it also means data analysis becomes more complex: fluorescent puncta must reliably and efficiently be detected in the low signal, high noise, heterogeneous background environments of cells and tissue. We present a bioimaging-segmentation method that accomplishes this. It detects features over a broad range of spatial scales: from single proteins to complex cell phenotypes. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in both precision and speed, using image gradients to separate Gaussian-shaped objects from background features. We demonstrate that this approach both works robustly on simple test systems, and that it enables us to extract previously unseen correlations between Parkinson’s Disease-relevant $\\alpha$-synuclein oligomers and multiple different cells types in the human brain. This sensitive, computationally efficient approach will enable fluorescent puncta and cellular features to be distinguished in cellular and tissue environments with a sensitivity down to the level of the single protein.",

      "description": "Despite our rapidly growing knowledge about the human genome, we do not know all of the genes required for some of the most basic functions of life. To start to fill this gap we developed a high-throughput phenotypic screening platform combining potent gene silencing by RNA interference, time-lapse microscopy and computational image processing. We carried out a genome-wide phenotypic profiling of each of the approximately 21,000 human protein-coding genes by two-day live imaging of fluorescently labelled chromosomes. Phenotypes were scored quantitatively by computational image processing, which allowed us to identify hundreds of human genes involved in diverse biological functions including cell division, migration and survival. As part of the Mitocheck consortium, this study provides an in-depth analysis of cell division phenotypes and makes the entire high-content data set available as a resource to the community.",

      "description": "Before production, the siRNA sequences were mapped (using BLAST) against the human genome using ENSEMBL genome database version 27. Only designs with 100% homology to the target gene, unique targeting in the genome and targeting all or most transcripts of the target gene were accepted for production. SiRNAs were redesigned if they failed these criteria. The silencer siRNAs were all chemically synthesized with a length of 21 bases and 2 bases overhang. A previously described protocol21 was used with minor modifications. The siRNA-gelatine transfection solution was prepared in 384 well plates (NalgeNunc) as described using a Microlab STAR (Hamilton) liquid handling robot with the following modifications. 5 _ l of siRNA solution (30 M), 3 _ l Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 0.4 M sucrose and 3.5 _ l Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were mixed and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. After incubation 7.25 l of 0.2% gelatine and 3.5x10-4% fibronectin (both Sigma-Aldrich) were added. In some experiments 0.5 _ l of a 40 _ M marker solution of Cy3 labelled DNA oligonucleotide was added together with the siRNA to judge transfection efficiency. These final siRNA transfection cocktails were then arrayed onto single-well chambered LabTek coverglass live cell imaging dishes (NalgeNunc) using a ChipWriter 1 chambered LabTek coverglass live cell imaging dishes (NalgeNunc) using a ChipWriter Compact Robot (Bio-Rad) with solid pins (Point Technologies) resulting in a spot volume of ~4 nl (containing ~5 ng siRNA) and a spot diameter of ~400 _ m and a spot to spot distance of 1125 _ m mirroring one 384 well plate per chamber. SiRNA microarrays were printed in 48 replicates then dried and stored in plastic boxes containing drying pearls orange (Fluka) at least over night. After drying, 1.1x105 HeLa-H2B-GFP cells were plated on the microarrays in a total volume of 1.5 ml culture medium (DMEM containing 4.5 g/l glucose, 10 % heat- inactivated foetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin), and incubated for 16 h at 37oC and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected simply by growing on siRNA spots without further manipulation. After 16 h incubation the 1.5ml culture medium was removed and replaced by 4 ml preheated CO2-independent imaging medium (Invitrogen) (containing 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 _ g/ml streptomycin). In order to prevent any gas exchange the live cell microarrays were sealed using baysilone paste (Bayer) and kept for one additional hour in the pre-heated incubation chamber of an Olympus (IX-81; Olympus-Europe) microscope.",

An image based autofocusing routine22 was used to focus on the maximum number of interphase cells (scoring size, intensity, contrast) in a field of view. The focus z-coordinates of the transfected cell microarray were saved during the first round of imaging. The temperature stability of the incubated system allowed us to reuse the saved focus map for 48 hours without further autofocusing between the 30 min imaging intervals. As cells needed on average ~1 hour to go through mitosis, we obtained ~2 mitotic images per cell enabling us to detect delays  30 minutes, or a mitotic index change from 5 % to 7.5 %. Higher time resolution would increase the sensitivity to even more subtle delays but increase overall data volume. Illumination of the specimen was reduced to the minimum necessary for sufficient signal to noise ratio for automated phenotyping (see below) with exposure times of 18-50 ms (GFP). Data was compressed without loss (ZIP) on the fly, buffered locally on the microscope computers and then saved on a 5 TB network-attached-storage.

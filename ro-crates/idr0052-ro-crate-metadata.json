Depending on the genetic modification, one or more of the following antibiotics were supplied to the culture at the stated final concentration: Geneticin 500 μg/ml, Hygromycin B 200 μg/ml or Puromycin 0.5 μg/ml. Once the cells reached 80-90% confluence, they were passaged and only a fraction of the cells were cultured in a fresh dish. All cells tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.  Proteins of interests were expressed as GFP fusions from homozygously-edited genomic loci or in a few cases from a stably-integrated BAC.  Confocal microscopy was performed on Zeiss LSM780, Confocor 3, laser scanning microscopes using 40x, NA 1.2 water DIC Plan-Apochromat objectives and the GaAsP detectors equipped with an incubation chamber. Time-lapse imaging was performed using the ZEN 2012 software combined with custom software. Mitotic cells were imaged live every 90 seconds for 60 minutes, taking 31 z-planes with a spatial resolution of 0.25 μm in x-y and 0.75 μm in z. At the end of acquisition, FCS measurements were performed at two positions in and four around the nucleus with a distance of 2 μm to the ellipse boundary for 30 seconds each.",

SiR-DNA was excited with 633 nm (HeNe laser at 0.3%) and detected with GaAsP detectors at 642–695 nm. After one prebleach image, a region of interest covering approximately half of the chromatin in the fifth z plane was bleached using a squared region of 40 × 30 pixels (488 nm laser at 100%; 100 repetitions), and time-lapse videos were recorded.",

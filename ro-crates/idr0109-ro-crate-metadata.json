      "description": "Deep learning has emerged as the technique of choice for identifying hidden patterns in cell imaging data, but is often criticized as ‘black-box’. Here, we demonstrate that a generative neural network captures subtle details of cell appearance, which permit the prediction of the metastatic efficiency of patient-derived melanoma xenografts with known clinical outcomes. To probe the predictor, we used the network to generate “in-silico” cell images that amplified the critical predictive cellular features. These images unveiled pseudopodial extensions and increased light scattering as hallmark properties of metastatic cells. We validated this interpretation using live cells spontaneously transitioning between states indicative of low and high metastatic efficiency. This study illustrates how the application of Artificial Intelligence can support the identification of cellular properties that are predictive of complex phenotypes and integrated cell functions, but are too subtle to be identified in the raw imagery by a human expert.",

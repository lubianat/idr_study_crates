      "description": "Viral infectious diseases span a myriad of maladies, including immunosuppression, cancer, organ failure and, if lacking effective treatment, even death. While numerous targeted antiviral therapies have been developed over the past century, many viral diseases still lack effective antivirals to date. Revisiting compounds approved for other applications offers accelerated development, and automated screening and data processing boost the feasibility of the re-purposing approach. Here, we extended our high-content image-based platform  on three human viruses differing in genome composition, envelope state, and tropism, namely human rhinovirus (RV), Human rhinovirus (IAV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Among the 1,280 mainly FDA-approved compounds, we identified potent inhibitors and even enhancers of multi-round infection propagation in vitro. The most potent inhibitors were 5-azacytidin against RV-A16, clotrimazole against IAV-WSN, and raltitrexed against HSV-1. Clobetasol was found to significantly enhance HSV-1 infection. Remarkably, Aminacrine, a topical antiseptic, inhibited all three viruses tested. Follow-up experiments of the highest-scoring modulators confirmed their performance.",

      "description": "The screening was performed in four independent biological replicates on 384-well plates. Wet-lab liquid handling was performed using a Matrix WellMate dispenser and Matrix WellMate tubing cartridges. Prior to usage, tubings were rinsed with 125 ml autoclaved ddH2O followed by 125 ml autoclaved PBS. Pre-spotted compound plates were thawed at room temperature for 30 min, briefly centrifuged before compounds were dissolved in 10 μl/ well PBS. 6,000 HeLa Ohio cells/ well in 60 μl full medium were seeded onto the compounds using standard bore tubing cartridges. Following cell adhesion over night, the cells were inoculated with 30 PFU per well of RV-A16 in 10 μl full media using small bore tubing cartridges. Final compound concentration was 1.25 μM at 0.0125% DMSO. Infection was allowed to progress over multiple infection rounds for 48 h giving rise to foci of infected cells originating from a single first round infected cell termed plaque. Cells were fixed for 1 h at RT by addition of 26.6 μL 16% PFA and 4 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 in PBS using standard bore tubing cartridges. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS before PBS supplemented with 0.02% N3 was added and plates were sealed for long-term storage at 4°C.",

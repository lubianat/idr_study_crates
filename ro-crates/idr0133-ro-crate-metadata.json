      "description": "Robust, generalizable approaches to efficiently identify compounds with undesirable mechanisms of action in complex cellular assays remain elusive. Such a process would be useful for hit triage during high-throughput screening and, ultimately, predictive toxicology during drug development. Here, we report on the generation of Cell Painting and cellular health profiles for 218 prototypical cytotoxic and nuisance compounds in U-2 OS cells in a concentration-response format. Compounds causing cellular damage such as cytoskeletal poisons, genotoxins, nonspecific electrophiles, and redox-active compounds produced bioactive Cell Painting morphologies. Further, we show that lower-quality lysine acetyltransferase inhibitors and nonspecific electrophiles can be distinguished from more selective counter-parts. We propose that the purposeful inclusion of cytotoxic and nuisance reference compounds such as those profiled in this Resource will help with assay optimization and compound prioritization in complex cellular assays like Cell Painting.",

Image acquisition was performed using an Opera Cell::Explorer_automated spinning disk confocal microscope. The initial screen was performed using a 20x air objective lens (NA = 0.45) (PerkinElmer), and 12-30 fields of view were imaged in each well. Subsequent experiments were imaged using a 20_ water objective lens (NA = 0.6). Cell segmentation was performed using Acapella software (PerkinElmer).",

      "description": "Segmentation and feature measurements were performed using Columbus (PerkinElmer) automated analysis software. Nuclei were segmented using DAPI (Channel 1) and cell bodies were detected by DHE (Channel 3). Subcellular regions include: \"nucleus\", \"ring region\" (-2 to -7 pixels from nucleus border), \"nucleus region\" (1 pixel erosion of nucleus), \"cytoplasm\", and \"membrane region\" (0 to 5 pixels inward from cell border).  The following morphological features were calculated: area, roundness (form factor), length, width, and length/width were determined for nucleus and cell regions, the ratio of nuclear area:cell area (\"Nuc/Cell Area\") and areas of ring and membrane regions. The extent of cell-cell contact, i.e. \"Neighbor Fraction\", was calculated as follows: 1 - ((Outer Membrane Region area * 2) / (Inner Membrane Region area * 2)), where the \"Outer Membrane Region\" is a 1-pixel dilation from the cell edge and the \"Inner Membrane Region\" is a 1-pixel erosion from the cell edge. Intensities were measured for each channel in each region and regional mean values are reported. The amount of NF-kappaB in the nucleus of each cell was calculated as the log of the ratio of nuclear:ring region intensities (Channel 2). Two measures of edge ruffling (\"Ruffliness-Edge\" and \"Ruffliness-Ridge\") were calculated from the \"membrane region\" texture features SER-Edge and SER-Ridge (scale = 4 px, normalisation by kernel) divided by cell roundness. Nucleoli were visible in the DHE channel and the Spot finder module was used to measured the number, area, and intensity of each nucleolus (\"spot\"). Texture features were calculated for nuclear DNA using the DAPI channel: Haralick distance = 1 px, \"nucleus\"; SER (Spot, Hole, Edge, Ridge, Valley, Saddle, Bright, Dark) scale =  0 px, normalisation by region, \"nucleus\"; and SER-Dark scale = 3 px, normalisation by region, \"nucleus region\". Border objects were removed and dead or poorly-segmented cells were removed by applying the filter: \"Nuc/Cell Area\" > 0.02 AND \"Ring NFkB Intensity\" > 100 Mitotic cells were binned using the following criteria: \"Nucleus Roundness\" < 0.9 AND \"DAPI Nucleus Haralick Sum Variance 1 px\" > 0.04 AND \"DAPI nucleus Haralick Homogeneity 1 px\" < 0.32 AND \"Nucleus Region Channel1 SER-Dark 3 px\" < 0.001. Interphase cells were further binned using the following criteria: \"Nucleus Roundness\" > 0.7 AND \"DAPI nucleus Haralick Sum Variance 1 px\" < 0.1 AND \"DAPI nucleus Haralick Homogeneity 1 px\" > 0.05. Mean, SD, CV, Median, Max, and Min feature values and counts for all filtered cells, interphase cells only, and mitotic cells only are included for each plate. PCA, clustering, and statistical tests. Principal component analysis was carried out using Cluster 3.0 and MATLAB software based on Z-scores [(value-mean)/SD]. Hierarchi- cal clustering was performed with Cluster 3.0 and visualized using Java Tree View. P values were determined using Student's t-test and ANOVA (Excel and MATLAB). R and R2 values were determined using Excel or MATLAB (Pearson correlation unless otherwise specified).",

To account for recovery, the sorbitol medium was replaced with fresh untreated medium for the set period of time. To induce oxidative stress, 0.5mM of sodium arsenite (Sigma) was added to the medium. To induce heat stress, cells were placed in an incubator at 42°C and 5% carbon dioxide for 1hr. For heat stress recovery, cells were returned to an incubator at 37°C and 5% carbon dioxide for the determined time. For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature (RT). Cells were permeabilised and non-specific antibody binding was blocked using 0.3% Triton-X containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) in PBS for 60 minutes. Primary antibodies used are β-III-tubulin (abcam; ab41489; chicken; 1:1000), TDP-43 (ProteinTech; 12892-1-AP; rabbit; 1:400), SFPQ (abcam; ab11825; mouse; 1:400), FUS (Santa Cruz; sc-47711; mouse; 1:200), hnRNPA1 (Cell Signaling; 8443S; rabbit; 1:500), hnRNPK (Santa Cruz; sc-28380; mouse; 1:500) hnRNPM (Santa Cruz; sc-134360, mouse, 1:500), PABP (abcam; ab21060; rabbit; 1:400), Cleaved-Caspase 3 (Cell Signaling; Asp175; rabbit; 1:300).",

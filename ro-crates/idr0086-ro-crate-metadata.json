      "description": "Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization plays a key role in regulating mammalian genome function, however many of its physical features at the single-cell level remain underexplored. Here we use 3D super-resolution and scanning electron microscopy to analyze structural and functional nuclear organization in somatic cells. We identify linked chromatin domains (CDs) composed of irregular ~200-300-nm-wide aggregates of nucleosomes that can overlap with individual topologically associating domains and are distinct from a surrounding RNA-populated interchromatin region. High-content mapping uncovers confinement of cohesin and active histone modifications to surfaces and enrichment of repressive modifications towards the core of CDs in both hetero- and euchromatic regions. This nanoscale functional topography is temporarily relaxed in postreplicative chromatin, but remarkably persists after ablation of cohesin. Our findings establish CDs as physical and functional modules of mesoscale genome organization.",

The Zeiss Capella FIB column was repositioned at a 90deg angle to the SEM column. The block face was imaged by a 240 pA electron beam with 1.0 keV landing energy at 200 kHz (HeLa) or by a 2 nA electron beam with 1.2 keV landing energy at 500 kHz (U2-OS). The x-y pixel resolution was set at 4 nm (HeLa) and 8 nm (U2-OS). A focused Ga ion beam of 15 nA at 30 keV milled away ~3 nm (HeLa 'G1'), ~5.6 nm (HeLa 'G2'), and ~5 nm (U2-OS) of material from the block face for each section (thickness estimated based on the average of SEM working distance and FIB milling voltage). The newly exposed surface was then imaged again. The milling / imaging cycle continued about once every 150 s for one month to capture an entire cell (50 x 8 x 68 ?m3) at 4 nm voxel (HeLa) or every 40 s for 6 days to capture an entire cell (104 x 8 x 42 ?m3) at 8 nm voxel (U2-OS). Each raw image stack was aligned and registered using a scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) plug-in through Fiji, the U2-OS cell volume was further binned by a factor of 2 along the milling axis. A subvolume containing the nucleus was cropped from the whole cell stack for further processing and analysis. Machine learning based segmentation of FIB-SEM data was performed using Ilastik 1.3.3."

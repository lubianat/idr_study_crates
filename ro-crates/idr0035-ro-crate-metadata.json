      "description": "The application of high-content imaging in conjunction with multivariate clustering techniques has recently shown value in the confirmation of cellular activity and further characterization of drug mode of action following pharmacologic perturbation. However, such practical examples of phenotypic profiling of drug response published to date have largely been restricted to cell lines and phenotypic response markers that are amenable to basic cellular imaging. As such, these approaches preclude the analysis of both complex heterogeneous phenotypic responses and subtle changes in cell morphology across physiologically relevant cell panels. Here, we describe the application of a cell-based assay and custom designed image analysis algorithms designed to monitor morphologic phenotypic response in detail across distinct cancer cell types. We further describe the integration of these methods with automated data analysis workflows incorporating principal component analysis, Kohonen neural networking, and kNN classification to enable rapid and robust interrogation of such data sets. We show the utility of these approaches by providing novel insight into pharmacologic response across four cancer cell types, Ovcar3, MiaPaCa2, and MCF7 cells wild-type and mutant for p53. These methods have the potential to drive the development of a new generation of novel therapeutic classes encompassing pharmacologic compositions or polypharmacology in appropriate disease context.  Note: The images in idr0035/screenA were generated by Caie et al, 2010 and are from MCF7 wild-type cells only.  They were obtained from the Broad BioImage Benchmark Collection image set BBBC021v1.

All media and supplements were supplied by Sigma. All cells were maintained at 37oC, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity. For high-content assays, cells were resuspended in Accutase (Sigma) and plated on collagen-coated black 96-well clear bottom plates (Becton Dickinson) using a WellMate-fine bore (Matrix) at 5,000 cells per well in 95 uL media. These plates were subsequently cultured at 37oC, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity for 24 hours before compound addition. All cell lines were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.",

Secondary antibody solution of (40 uL) Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L; Molecular probes A21202; diluted at 1:500), Phalloidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular probes A12380; diluted 1:500), and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma D8417) diluted at 1:250 in blocking buffer was incubated with cells for 45 minutes in the dark. Cells were washed three times with PBS. Deep red HCS cell mask (Molecular probes, H34560) diluted at 1:120,000 was added and incubated for 10 minutes. Cell were washed twice with PBS. Plates were sealed with black plate sealers before imaging.All images were acquired on the automated ImageXpress 5000A high-content imaging platform (Molecular Devices) using a x20 PanFluor ELWD Ph1 DM objective and a 16-bit camera binning resolution of 1.

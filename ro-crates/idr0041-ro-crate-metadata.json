      "description": "Using the cell and nuclear boundaries as landmarks, we generated a 4D image data-driven, canonical model of a human mitotic cell. This model is used to integrate the dynamic distribution of 3D concentration data for many mitotic proteins imaged by calibrated fluorescence microscopy in a large number of dividing cells. Analysis of the data allows to automatically identify sub-cellular structures and quantify the timing and magnitude of protein fluxes between structures, as well as predicting dynamic multi-molecular biological processes such as organelle assembly and disassembly. The integrated experimental and computational method enables building a 4D protein atlas of the dividing human cell.",

Time-lapse imaging was performed using the ZEN 2012 software combined with custom software. Mitotic cells were imaged live every 90 seconds for 60 minutes, taking 31 z-planes with a spatial resolution of 0.25 μm in x-y and 0.75 μm in z. At the end of acquisition, FCS measurements were performed at two positions in and four around the nucleus with a distance of 2 μm to the ellipse boundary for 30 seconds each.",

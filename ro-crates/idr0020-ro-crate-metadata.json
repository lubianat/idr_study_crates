      "description": "Exponentially growing cells were reverse transfected with 40nM of siRNA.  All screens were performed at a single timepoint in duplicate. A Multidrop Combi Reagent dispenser (Thermo Scientific) was used throughout the transfection protocol to ensure even liquid addition. 5 ul of OPTIMEM (Gibco) was added to each well to redissolve the siRNA. Plates were centrifuged and incubated at RT for 5 min. Lipofectamine RNAimax (Invitrogen) was added in OPTIMEM to a final concentration of 8ul Lipofectamine to 1 ml OPTIMEM and incubated at RT for 5 min. 5ul of OPTIMEM/Lipofectamine mix was then added to the plates. Plates were centrifuged and incubated at RT for 20 min. NS-shRNA and ch- TOG shRNA HeLa cells were trypsinised and counted using an automated cells counter (Countess; Invitrogen). Cells were centrifuged at 1000 xg for 4 min. Media was aspirated and cells were resuspended in OPTIMEM to a final concentration of 2x10^5 cells per ml. 10 ul of cell suspension was added to the plates, plates were centrifuged and incubated at 37oC for 4 hr. After 4 hr, 10ul of DMEM + 30% FBS + 3% P/S and 6ug/ml Doxycycline (Dox; Sigma) was added to the plates (final concentration 10% FBS, 1% P/S and 2ug/ml Dox). Plates were centrifuged and incubated at 37oC for 41 hr. Before fixation, 10ul cell medium plus 80 uM of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Tocris) was added to all plates for 1 hr (final concentration of MG132 is 20uM). All fixing and staining was carried out using the PerkinElmer Cell::Explorer system coupled to automated liquid handling equipment. Solutions were dispensed using a Multidrop Combi Reagent dispenser (Thermo Scientific) and aspirated/washed using a Biotek washer with 96 pins. Plates were fixed by adding an equal volume of pre-warmed (37oC) 8% formaldehyde/PBS solution to the wells and incubated at 37oC for 10 min. Cells were then permeabilised in pre-warmed PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at RT. Cells were then blocked in 1% BSA/PBS (blocking solution) for 1 hr at RT. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution: MTs were labelled using an anti-alpha-tubulin antibody (1:1000, mouse, Cat no. A11126, Invitrogen) and mitotic cells were labelled using anti-Ser10 PhosphoHistone H3 (1:1000, rabbit, Cat no. 06-570, Millipore). Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 hr at RT, then washed three times in PBS. Secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer: anti-mouse Alexa 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa 647 (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated in secondary antibody for 1hr at RT, then washed three times in PBS. Cells were finally incubated in 1ug/ml Hoescht (H 33258, Sigma) diluted in PBS for 15 min at RT before a final wash in PBS and imaging. In both libraries genes are targeted by a pool of four siRNAs.",

      "description": "All plates were imaged using the PerkinElmer Opera high-content confocal screening platform with spinning disc. 30 fields of view per well were images using a 20x air objective, NA 0.45. On average, this generated images of 30-40 NS-shRNA and 250-300 ch-TOG-shRNA mitotic cells per well. All Image analysis was performed using custom algorithms built in the Columbus software (PerkinElmer). Image analysis protocols are summarised below: All nuclei were detected and segmented using Hoechst staining (total cell number). Intensity of PHH3 was measured in each nucleus and mitotic nuclei were determined using a minimum PHH3 intensity threshold (mitotic index). The cytoplasm of mitotic nuclei was segmented using RFP expression. Cells touching the edge of the image (incomplete segmentation) and poorly segmented cells (cells below a roundness threshold of 0.8) were excluded at this point. Tubulin intensity was measured in each mitotic cell and cells with very low tubulin immunostaining (where individual spindle poles could not be distinguished, below a mean of 30) were excluded since these are poorly segmented in later steps. Spindle poles were detected using the Spot Finder building block. Briefly, this detects spindle poles based on local intensity maxima and we defined individual poles as having a relative spot intensity of greater than 0.095 and a splitting coefficient of 0.56. This successfully defined individual spindle poles, and data was validated by manually scoring randomly selected fields. Cells with greater than two spindle poles were classed as multipolar. To detect multinucleate cells, nuclei and mitotic nuclei were detected as above but this time, mitotic nuclei were excluded from the analysis. The cytoplasm of interphase cells was then segmented based on RFP localisation and the number of nuclei per cell scored to determine the percentage of cells with multipolar spindles.",

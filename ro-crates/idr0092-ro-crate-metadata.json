      "description": "Intestinal organoids are an excellent model to study epithelial biology. Yet, the selection of analytical tools to accurately quantify heterogeneous organoid cultures remains limited. Here, we developed a semi-automated organoid screening method, which we applied to a library of highly specific chemical probes to identify epigenetic regulators of intestinal epithelial biology. The role of epigenetic modifiers in adult stem cell systems, such as the intestinal epithelium, is still undefined. Based on this resource dataset, we identified several targets that affected epithelial cell differentiation, including HDACs, EP300/CREBBP, LSD1, and type I PRMTs, which were verified by complementary methods. For example, we show that inhibiting type I PRMTs, which leads enhanced epithelial differentiation, blocks the growth of adenoma but not normal organoid cultures. Thus, epigenetic probes are powerful tools to study intestinal epithelial biology and may have therapeutic potential.",

A custom ImageJ/Fiji macro (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3951126) was used to collect single positions and layers for each well, to save a stack (ImageJ brightfield stack) and projections, and to perform a simple organoid segmentation (\"\"ImageJ workflow\"\"). For the segmentation, a Sobel edge detector was applied to each z-stack layer (ImageJ edge stack), a standard deviation Zprojection of the edge stack was generated, and particle analysis with optional manual correction was performed after several binary operations and thresholding. For an improved segmentation, to distinguish different organoid phenotypes, the ImageJ workflow was combined with the interactive machine learning software Ilastik. Training data was taken from the same experiment and excluded from further analysis. In a first step, pixel classification on an intensity summary projection of the ImageJ edge stack was used to separate between background and object borders. The generated pixel prediction maps were used as input in a second object classification step together with minimum projections of the ImageJ brightfield stack. The following label classes were used: Organoid, big sphere, small sphere, cluster, debris, background mislabelled as organoid, air bubble, edge of well plate.",

      "description": "To devise an economical set of phenomic profiling assays, we assembled a library of 1,008 approved drugs and tool compounds manually annotated to 218 unique MoAs and an addtional 169 natural products, and we profiled each compound at four concentrations in live-cell, high-content imaging screens against a panel of 15 reporter cell lines, which expressed a diverse set of fluorescent organelle and pathway markers in three distinct cell lineages. Phenomic profiling can be used for compound target identification or mechanism of action (MoA) prediction and other applications in drug discovery. For 41 of 83 MoAs with sufficiently many active compounds, phenomic profiles accurately ranked the reference compounds (AUC-ROC ³0.9) in at least one of our cell lines.",

To control for experimental variation, two technical replicates were included for each compound treatment in each imaging batch and two batches were prepared for each reporter cell line. Cells were grown for an additional 24 hours before imaging. As cells were actively growing during imaging (doubling time 18-24 hours), the last 10 plates in a batch were seeded at a lower cell density than the first 10 plates to compensate for the additional growth period they would encounter before imaging. The exact seeding densities were optimized for each cell line so that cells in control wells were 50% to 80% confluent at the time of imaging.",

Five different combinations of organelle and pathway markers were introduced into each cell type. Cells were imaged on a Cell Voyager 7000 (Yokogawa, Tokyo, Japan) high-throughput microscope equipped with a climate control chamber (37°C, 5% CO2). Images of BFP (ex: 405 nm, em: 445/45), GFP (ex: 488 nm, em: 525/50), and RFP/fusionRed (ex:561 nm, em: 593/46) were acquired at two to three sites per well using a 20× objective lens (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan; NA 0.75). All liquid dispensation, compound treatment, and imaging steps were conducted on an automated platform designed specifically for live-cell microscopy screens. Typically, twenty 384-well plates were imaged per day over a 20-hour period.",

      "description": "Mammalian gene expression patterns are controlled by regulatory elements, which interact within Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). The relationship between activation of regulatory elements, formation of structural chromatin interactions and gene expression during development is unclear. Here, we present Tiled-C, a low-input Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) technique. We use this approach to study chromatin architecture at high spatial and temporal resolution through in vivo mouse erythroid differentiation. In this dataset, we measure nascent transcription of the mouse alpha-globin genes by FISH using oligonucleotide probes that are specific for the alpha-globin introns. We measure the initial stages of alpha-globin upregulation in three subsets of early erythroid progenitors (S0-low, S0-medium and S1) and compare these to the levels observed in a positive control (mature, Ter119+ mouse erythroblasts) and in two negative controls (mouse primary brain, which does not express alpha-globin, and a no primary antibody control).",

      "description": "Primary erythroid progenitor cells were isolated from fetal livers, which were freshly isolated at e12.5-e13.5 from C57BL/6 mouse embryos. 5-15 livers were pooled together for each experimental replicate, mechanically dissociated in staining buffer (PBS, 0.2% BSA, 5mM Glucose) and strained through a 30-μm strainer. Cells were immunostained at 4 °C in the presence of rabbit IgG (200 μg/ml, Jackson Laboratories 015-000-003) to block Fc receptors. To enrich for early erythroid progenitors, cells were first stained with 5 μg/ml biotin-conjugated anti-Ter119 (BD 553672) for 30 minutes, before magnetic depletion using streptavidin nanobeads (BioLegend Mojosort 480016) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then incubated with 0.5 μg/ml APC-conjugated streptavidin (BD 553672), 0.33 μg/ml PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD71 (BioLegend 113811) and a panel of 5 FITC-conjugated lineage antibodies (anti-CD41, anti-CD45R, anti-CD3e, anti-CD11b and anti-Ly-6G/6C, all at 1 μg/ml; BD 553848, 553087, 553061, 557396 and 553126, respectively) for 45 minutes. Cells were then resuspended in FACS running buffer (staining buffer plus 2 mM EDTA). 0.66 μg/ml Hoechst was added immediately prior to sorting in order to distinguish live cells. Cells were sorted into Eppendorf tubes containing 500 μl RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS using a BD FACSAria™ Fusion machine with a 100 μM nozzle size.",
